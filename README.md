### Responsiveness

This project has basic responsiveness built in - it should display fine on both desktops and phones, including
momentum scrolling on iPhone.

### Colors

I'm clearly not a designer - I've overridden scss color defaults in bootstrap as an example of how to do it,
not an example of my ability to choose colors :)
